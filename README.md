# HALO 😇

A little bot that tries to take care of you when you're using your Mac. It tells you cute, self care things, and tries not to stress you out.

#### How to install

- Instructions for installing halo is recorded here https://youtu.be/qdL4G1hdIho, or you can also follow the instructions below.


- Go to [release page](https://github.com/gauravchl/halo/releases) and download latest version. eg: [halo-1.0.0.dmg](https://github.com/gauravchl/halo/releases/download/v1.0.0/halo-1.0.0.dmg)
- Click on downloaded file and move it to application folder.

- Launch it!

- If you see a message like: **“halo” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.** You will have to allow your mac to open the app downloaded from other than app store. Or buy me a  $100 apple identification certificate to upload it to app store 😅. Alternatively you can build it from source as well, simply cd into repo and run `npm run build`. Build will be inside dist directory.

- To allow mac to open app go to **System Preferences** -> **Security & Privacy** -> then click Open on blocked app.

- Have some fun ✌️
